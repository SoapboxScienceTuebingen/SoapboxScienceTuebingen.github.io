## Our mission

Soapbox Science is a novel public outreach platform for promoting women and
non-binary scientists and the science they do. Events transform public areas
into an arena for public learning and scientific debate; they follow the format
of London Hyde Park’s Speaker’s Corner, which is historically an arena for
public debate. With Soapbox Science, we want to make sure that everyone has the
opportunity to enjoy, learn from, heckle, question, probe, interact with and be
inspired by some of our leading scientists. No middle man, no PowerPoint slide,
no amphitheatre – just remarkable women and non-binary scientists who are there
to amaze you with their latest discoveries, and to answer the science questions
you have been burning to ask. Or simply hear them talk about what
fascinates them, and why they think they have the most fantastic job in the
world!

      I am a PhD student in Andrei Lupas' group at the Max Planck Institute for
      Biology, studying protein design with a combination of computer and

      I am a third-year PhD student in Cancer Biology. Originally from Spain, I did my
      Master in Tübingen. Now, almost at the end of the PhD I´m looking forward to
      moving in the neuropsychology field as I fell in love with our minds and their
      great power on us. At this years’ Tübingen Soapbox Science, I will give a quick
      view about skin cancer, what is known, what is still not known, interesting
      facts… Enthusiastic, passionate and empathetic; that is me!

      IRTG2804, a research training group with the goal of
      understanding women’s mental health across the reproductive
      years. While my field of expertise is premenstrual dysphoric
      disorder (a severe form of PMS) and depression in women, I am
      passionate about researching women’s (mental) health in general
      because it has been overlooked for so long in science, and there
      is still so much we don’t know! The potential to improve the
      lives of millions of women through further research in this
      field is truly endless.

      with a good board game or find my zen through yoga.

      I am doing an interdisciplinary PhD at Psychiatry researching
      the linkage between gender and mental health and a specific
      focus on mental health during and after a pregnancy. I will
      present my research on gender identity across Europe and the
      linkage to mental health. I am excited to share this relatively
      niche, yet fascinating scientific field with the general public
      at this years’ Tübingen Soapbox Science. It is my hope to
      eventually inspire young female scholars to achieve their
      scholastic dreams.
