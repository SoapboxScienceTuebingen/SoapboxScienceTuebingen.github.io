I am a third-year PhD student in Cancer Biology. Originally from Spain, I did my Master in Tübingen. Now, almost at the end of the PhD I´m looking forward to moving in the neuropsychology field as I fell in love with our minds and their great power on us. At this years’ Tübingen Soapbox Science, I will give a quick view about skin cancer, what is known, what is still not known, interesting facts… Enthusiastic, passionate and empathetic; that is me!
