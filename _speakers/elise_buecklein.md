I am currently a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Medicine (Psychiatry) at the University of Tübingen and part of the IRTG2804, a research training group with the goal of understanding women’s mental health across the reproductive years. While my field of expertise is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (a severe form of PMS) and depression in women, I am passionate about researching women’s (mental) health in general because it has been overlooked for so long in science, and there is still so much we don’t know! The potential to improve the lives of millions of women through further research in this field is truly endless.
