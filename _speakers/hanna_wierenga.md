I am doing an interdisciplinary PhD at Psychiatry researching the linkage between gender and mental health and a specific focus on mental health during and after a pregnancy. I will present my research on gender identity across Europe and the linkage to mental health. I am excited to share this relatively niche, yet fascinating scientific field with the general public at this years’ Tübingen Soapbox Science. It is my hope to eventually inspire young female scholars to achieve their scholastic dreams.
