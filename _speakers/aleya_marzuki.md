I am a postdoctoral scientist working in the Universitätsklinikum Tübingen. My research seeks to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms driving mental health conditions particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In my talk I will present a study where people with OCD were asked to record their symptoms on their mobile phone and play a short engaging game multiple times over a two-week period. Through this, we successfully mapped how OCD symptoms evolve and fluctuate over time, and how these relate to their performance on the game.
