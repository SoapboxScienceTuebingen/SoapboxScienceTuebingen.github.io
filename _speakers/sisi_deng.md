A gynecologist pursuing a PhD at the iFIT Cluster, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital of Tübingen, I specialize in endometriosis and ovarian cancer research. Through the BMBF ENDO-RELIEF project, I explore disease mechanisms using MALDI imaging, mass spectrometry, and NMR-based metabolomics. At this years’ Tübingen Soapbox Science, I would like to share our latest findings and further raise awareness of endometriosis and my research.
